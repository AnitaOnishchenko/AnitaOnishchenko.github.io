    <h2>2017â€“2019: K-12 album and film</h2>
    <p align="center"><img class="resize" src="../lab2/images/K-12.png"></p>
    <p>In March 2017, Martinez expressed her wishes to produce a film telling the story of each song from her second album, explaining "I'm currently writing a film...
      I'm going to spend the year working on it, directing, shooting, make up and everything so it's a lot of work". On May 15, 2019, Martinez released the first
      teaser trailer for the album revealing the title K-12, released on September 6, with the album cover unveiled a day later through Instagram. While the film was
      available in select theaters worldwide, Martinez also posted the film to YouTube and included it in a version of the downloadable K-12 album. In an interview with
      PeopleTV, Melanie mentioned that she has two sequels and two visual albums planned to follow on from the K-12 album and film. She said, "I have my next film planned
      out, as far as what I want to do, and the film after that and they both have albums attached to them...Hopefully [the process] will be faster this time and it won't
      be like four years because I've done it at least once and I'm past all those learning curves that I had to kind of reach and figure out."
